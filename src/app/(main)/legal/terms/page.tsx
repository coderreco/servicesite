            Welcome to <strong>Cleaning Website Templates</strong>, where we
            specialize in providing optimized website templates to help
            businesses establish a strong online presence. For a one-time
            upfront payment of <strong>$499</strong> (standard price before any
            discounts), you receive our website template tailored to your brand.
            To ensure your website remains up-to-date and functions smoothly, we
            operate on a monthly subscription of <strong>$199</strong> (standard
            price before any discounts) for a period of 24 months. This
            subscription includes hosting services and unlimited support
            tickets, which can be used for fixes, changes, alterations, new
            content, integrations, and more. Support tickets are handled one at
            a time and are exclusively available for the website and product we
            provide, not for any other software or services.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the conclusion of the 24-month contract, you have the option to
            transfer the hosting to your own account. If you wish to continue
            receiving support services, we can establish a new support agreement
            tailored to your needs.
